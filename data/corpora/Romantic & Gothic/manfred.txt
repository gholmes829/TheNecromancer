SCENE I. MANFRED alone -- Scene, a Gothic gallery -- Time, Midnight.

MANFRED 
	The lamp must be replenish'd, but even then 
	It will not burn so long as I must watch: 
	My slumbers -- if I slumber -- are not sleep, 
	But a continuance of enduring thought, 
	Which then I can resist not: in my heart 
	There is a vigil, and these eyes but close
	To look within; and yet I live, and bear 
	The aspect and the form of breathing men. 
	But grief should be the instructor of the wise; 
	Sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most
	Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth, 
	The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life. 
	Philosophy and science, and the springs 
	Of wonder, and the wisdom of the world, 
	I have essayed, and in my mind there is 
	A power to make these subject to itself-- 
	But they avail not: I have done men good, 
	And I have met with good even among men-- 
	But this avail'd not: I have had my foes, 
	And none have baffled, many fallen before me--
	But this avail'd not: -- Good, or evil, life, 
	Powers, passions, all I see in other beings, 
	Have been to me as rain unto the sands, 
	Since that all-nameless hour. I have no dread, 
	And feel the curse to have no natural fear, 
	Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes, 
	Or lurking love of something on the earth.-- 
	Now to my task.--
			Mysterious Agency! 
	Ye spirits of the unbounded Universe!
	Whom I have sought in darkness and in light--
	Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell
	In subtler essence -- ye, to whom the tops
	Of mountains inaccessible are haunts,
	And earth's and ocean's caves familiar things--
	I call upon ye by the written charm
	Which gives me power upon you -- Rise! appear! [A pause
	They come not yet. -- Now by the voice of him
	Who is the first among you -- by this sign,
	Which makes you tremble -- by the claims of him
	Who is undying, -- Rise! appear! Appear!	[A pause
	If it he so. -- Spirits of earth and air,
	Ye shall not thus elude me: by a power,
	Deeper than all yet urged, a tyrant-spell,
	Which had its birth-place in a star condemn'd,
	The burning wreck of a demolish'd world,
	A wandering hell in the eternal space;
	By the strong curse which is upon my soul,
	The thought which is within me and around me,
	I do compel ye to my will. -- Appear!

[A star is seen at the darker end of the gallery; it is stationary; and a voice 
	is heard singing]

FIRST SPIRIT
	Mortal! to thy bidding bow'd,
	From my mansion in the cloud,
	Which the breath of twilight builds,
	And the summer's sun-set gilds
	With the azure and vermilion,
	Which is mix'd for my pavilion;
	Though thy quest may be forbidden,
	On a star-beam I have ridden;
	To thine adjuration bow'd,
	Mortal -- be thy wish avow'd!

Voice of the SECOND SPIRIT
	Mont Blanc is the monarch of mountains,
	  They crowned him long ago
	On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,
	  With a diadem of snow.
	Around his waist are forests braced,
	  The Avalanche in his hand;
	But ere it fall, that thundering ball
	  Must pause for my command.
	The Glacier's cold and restless mass
	  Moves onward day by day;
	But I am he who bids it pass,
	  Or with its ice delay.
	I am the spirit of the place,
	  Could make the mountain bow
	And quiver to his cavern'd base--
	  And what with me wouldst Thou?

Voice of the THIRD SPIRIT
	In the blue depth of the waters,
	  Where the wave hath no strife,
	Where the wind is a stranger,
	  And the sea-snake hath life,
	Where the Mermaid is decking
	  Her green hair with shells;
	Like the storm on the surface
	  Came the sound of thy spells;
	O'er my calm Hall of Coral
	  The deep echo roll'd--
	To the Spirit of Ocean
	  Thy wishes unfold

FOURTH SPIRIT
	Where the slumbering earthquake
	  Lies pillow'd on fire,
	And the lakes of bitumen
	  Rise boilingly higher;
	Where the roots of the Andes
	  Strike deep in the earth,
	As their summits to heaven
	  Shoot soaringly forth;
	I have quitted my birth-place,
	  Thy bidding to bide--
	Thy spell hath subdued me,
	Thy will be my guide!

FIFTH SPIRIT
	I am the Rider of the wind,
	  The Stirrer of the storm;
	The hurricane I left behind
	  Is yet with lightning warm;
	To speed to thee, o'er shore and sea
	  I swept upon the blast:
	The fleet I met sailed well, and yet
	  'Twill sink ere night be past.

SIXTH SPIRIT
	My dwelling is the shadow of the night,
	Why doth thy magic torture me with light?

SEVENTH SPIRIT
	The star which rules thy destiny,
	Was ruled, ere earth began, by me:
	It was a world as fresh and fair
	As e'er revolved round sun in air;
	Its course was free and regular,
	Space bosom'd not a lovelier star.
	The hour arrived -- and it became
	A wandering mass of shapeless flame,
	A pathless comet, -- and a curse,
	The menace of the universe;
	Still rolling on with innate force,
	Without a sphere, without a course,
	A bright deformity on high,
	The monster of the upper sky!
	And thou! beneath its influence born--
	Thou worm! whom I obey and scorn--
	Forced by a power (which is not thine,
	And lent thee but to make thee mine)
	For this brief moment to descend,
	Where these weak spirits round thee bend
	And parley with a thing like thee--
	What wouldst thou, Child of Clay! with me?

The SEVEN SPIRITS
	Earth, ocean, air, night, mountains, winds, thy star,
	  Are at thy beck and bidding, Child of Clay!
	Before thee at thy quest their spirits are--
	What wouldst thou with us, son of mortals -- say?

MANFRED  
	Forgetfulness--

FIRST SPIRIT
	Of what -- of whom -- and why?

MANFRED 
	Of that which is within me; read it there--
	Ye know it, and I cannot utter it.

SPIRIT 
	We can but give thee that which we possess:
	Ask of us subjects, sovereignty, the power
	O'er earth, the whole, or portion, or a sign
	Which shall control the elements, whereof
	We are the dominators, each and all,
	These shall be thine.

MANFRED 
				Oblivion, self-oblivion--
	Can ye not wring from out the hidden realms
	Ye offer so profusely what I ask?

SPIRIT 
	It is not in our essence, in our skill;
	But -- thou mayst die.

MANFRED 
				Will death bestow it on me?

SPIRIT 
	We are immortal, and do not forget;
	We are eternal; and to us the past
	Is, as the future, present. Art thou answered?

MANFRED 
	Ye mock me -- but the power which brought ye here
	Hath made you mine. Slaves, scoff not at my will!
	The mind, the spirit, the Promethean spark,
	The lightning of my being, is as bright,
	Pervading, and far-darting as your own,
	And shall not yield to yours, though coop'd in clay!
	Answer, or I will teach ye what I am.

SPIRIT 
	We answer as we answered; our reply
	Is even in thine own words.

MANFRED 
					Why say ye so?

SPIRIT 
	If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours,
	We have replied in telling thee, the thing
	Mortals call death hath nought to do with us.
	
MANFRED 
	I then have call'd ye from your realms in vain;
	Ye cannot, or ye will not, aid me.
	
SPIRIT	
					Say;
	What we possess we offer; it is thine:
	Bethink ere thou dismiss us, ask again--
	Kingdom, and sway, and strength, and length of days--

MANFRED 
	Accursed! what have I to do with days?
	They are too long already. -- Hence -- begone!

SPIRIT 
	Yet pause: being here, our will would do thee service;
	Bethink thee, is there then no other gift
	Which we can make not worthless in thine eyes?

MANFRED 
	No, none: yet stay -- one moment, ere we part--
	I would behold ye face to face. I hear
	Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,
	As music on the waters; and I see
	The steady aspect of a clear large star;
	But nothing more. Approach me as ye are,
	Or one, or all, in your accustom'd forms.

SPIRIT 
	We have no forms beyond the elements
	Of which we are the mind and principle:
	But choose a form -- in that we will appear.

MANFRED 
	I have no choice; there is no form on earth
	Hideous or beautiful to me. Let him,
	Who is most powerful of ye, take such aspect
	As unto him may seem most fitting. -- Come!

SEVENTH SPIRIT  [Appearing in the shape of a beautiful female figure] 
	Behold!

MANFRED 
	Oh God! if it be thus, and thou
	Art not a madness and a mockery,
	I yet might be most happy. -- I will clasp thee,
	And we again will be-- 
		 					[The figure vanishes
				My heart is crush'd!
							[MANFRED falls senseless

		[A voice is heard in the Incantation which follows]

	When the moon is on the wave,
	  And the glow-worm in the grass,
	And the meteor on the grave,
	  And the wisp on the morass;
	When the falling stars are shooting,
	And the answer'd owls are hooting,
	And the silent leaves are still
	In the shadow of the hill,
	Shall my soul be upon thine,
	With a power and with a sign.

	Though thy slumber may be deep,
	Yet thy spirit shall not sleep,
	There are shades which will not vanish,
	There are thoughts thou canst not banish;
	By a power to thee unknown,
	Thou canst never be alone;
	Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,
	Thou art gathered in a cloud;
	And for ever shalt thou dwell
	In the spirit of this spell.

	Though thou seest me not pass by,
	Thou shalt feel me with thine eye
	As a thing that, though unseen,
	Must be near thee, and hath been;
	And when in that secret dread
	Thou hast turn'd around thy head,
	Thou shalt marvel I am not
	As thy shadow on the spot,
	And the power which thou dost feel
	Shall he what thou must conceal.

	And a magic voice and verse
	Hath baptized thee with a curse;
	And a spirit of the air
	Hath begirt thee with a snare;
	In the wind there is a voice
	Shall forbid thee to rejoice;
	And to thee shall Night deny
	All the quiet of her sky;
	And the day shall have a sun,
	Which shall make thee wish it done.

	From thy false tears I did distil
	An essence which hath strength to kill;
	From thy own heart I then did wring
	The black blood in its blackest spring;
	From thy own smile I snatch'd the snake,
	For there it coil'd as in a brake;
	From thy own lip I drew the charm
	Which gave all these their chiefest harm;
	In proving every poison known,
	I found the strongest was thine own.

	By thy cold breast and serpent smile,
	By thy unfathom'd gulfs of guile,
	By that most seeming virtuous eye,
	By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;
	By the perfection of thine art
	Which pass'd for human thine own heart;
	By thy delight in others' pain,
	And by thy brotherhood of Cain,
	I call upon thee! and compel
	Thyself to be thy proper Hell!

	And on thy head I pour the vial
	Which doth devote thee to this trial;
	Nor to slumber, nor to die
	Shall be in thy destiny;
	Though thy death shall still seem near
	To thy wish, but as a fear;
	Lo! the spell now works around thee,
	And the clankless chain hath bound thee;
	O'er thy heart and brain together
	Hath the word been pass'd -- now wither!

SCENE II. The Mountain of the Jungfrau. --Time, Morning. -- MANFRED alone upon the Cliffs.

MANFRED 
	The spirits I have raised abandon me--
	The spells which I have studied baffle me--
	The remedy I reck'd of tortured me;
	I lean no more on super-human aid,
	It hath no power upon the past, and for
	The future, till the past be gulf'd in darkness,
	It is not of my search. -- My mother Earth!
	And thou fresh breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,
	Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.
	And thou, the bright eye of the universe,
	That openest over all, and unto all
	Art a delight -- thou shin'st not on my heart.
	And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge
	I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath
	Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs
	In dizziness of distance; when a leap,
	A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring
	My breast upon its rocky bosom's bed
	To rest for ever -- wherefore do I pause?
	I feel the impulse -- yet I do not plunge
	I see the peril -- yet do not recede;
	And my brain reels -- and yet my foot is firm:
	There is a power upon me which withholds
	And makes it my fatality to live;
	If it be life to wear within myself
	This barrenness of spirit, and to be
	My own soul's sepulchre, for I have ceased
	To justify my deeds unto myself--
	The last infirmity of evil. Ay,
	Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister		[an eagle passes
	Whose happy flight is highest into heaven
	Well mayst thou swoop so near me -- I should be
	Thy prey, and gorge thins eaglets; thou art gone
	Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine
	Yet pierces downward, onward, or above
	With a pervading vision. -- Beautiful!
	How beautiful is all this visible world!
	How glorious in its action and itself;
	But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,
	Half dust, half deity, alike unfit
	To sink or soar, with our mix'd essence make
	A conflict of its elements, and breathe
	The breath of degradation and of pride,
	Contending with low wants and lofty will
	Till our mortality predominates,
	And men are -- what they name not to themselves
	And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,
				[The Shepherd's pipe in the distance is heard
	The natural music of the mountain reed--
	For here the patriarchal days are not
	A pastoral fable -- pipes in the liberal air,
	Mix'd with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;
	My soul would drink those echoes.-Oh, that I were
	The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,
	A living voice, a breathing harmony
	A bodiless enjoyment--born and dying
	With the blest tone which made me!

		Enter from below a CHAMOIS HUNTER

CHAMOIS HUNTER. 
					Even so
	This way the chamois leapt: her nimble feet
	Have baffled me; my gains to-day will scarce
	Repay my break-neck travail. -- What is here?
	Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reach'd
	A height which none even of our mountaineers,
	Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb
	Is goodly, his mien manly, and his air
	Proud as a free-born peasant's, at this distance.--
	I will approach him nearer.

MANFRED 
	[not perceiving the other] To be thus--
	Grey-hair'd with anguish, like these blasted pines,
	Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,
	A blighted trunk upon a cursed root,
	Which but supplies a feeling to decay--
	And to be thus, eternally but thus,
	Having been otherwise! Now furrow'd o'er
	With wrinkles, plough'd by moments, not by years;
	And hours -- all tortured into ages -- hours
	Which I outlive! -- Ye toppling crags of ice!
	Ye avalanches, whom a breath draws down
	In mountainous overwhelming, come and crush me--
	I hear ye momently above, beneath,
	Crash with a frequent conflict; but ye pass,
	And only fall on things which still would live;
	On the young flourishing forest, or the hut
	And hamlet of the harmless villager.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	The mists begin to rise from up the valley;
	I'll warn him to descend, or he may chance
	To lose at once his way and life together.

MANFRED 
	The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds
	Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,
	Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,
	Whose every wave breaks on a living shore,
	Heaped with the damn'd like pebbles. -- I am giddy.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	I must approach him cautiously; if near,
	A sudden step will startle him, and he
	Seems tottering already.

MANFRED 
				Mountains have fallen
	Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock
	Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up
	The ripe green valleys with destruction's splinters;
	Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,
	Which crush'd the waters into mist, and made
	Their fountains find another channel -- thus,
	Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg--
	Why stood I not beneath it?

CHAMOIS HUNTER
					Friend! have a care,
	Your next step may be fatal! -- for the love
	Of him who made you, stand not on that brink!

MANFRED 
	[not hearing him]. Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;
	My bones had then been quiet in their depth;
	They had not then been strewn upon the rocks
	For the wind's pastime -- as thus -- thus they shall be--
	In this one plunge. -- Farewell, ye opening heavens!
	Look not upon me thus reproachfully--
	Ye were not meant for me -- Earth! take these atoms!

		[As MANFRED is in act to spring from the cliff; the CHAMOIS HUNTER seizes 
	and retains him with a sudden grasp]

CHAMOIS HUNTER
	Hold, madman! -- though aweary of thy life,
	Stain not our pure vales with thy guilty blood.--
	Away with me -- I will not quit my hold.

MANFRED 
	I am most sick at heart -- nay, grasp me not--
	I am all feebleness -- the mountains whirl
	Spinning around me -- I grow blind -- What art thou?

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	I'll answer that anon. -- Away with me --
	The clouds grow thicker -- there -- now lean on me --
	Place your foot here -- here, take this staff, and cling
	A moment to that shrub -- now give me your hand,
	And hold fast by my girdle -- softly -- well --
	The Chalet will be gained within an hour--
	Come on, we'll quickly find a surer footing,
	And something like a pathway, which the torrent
	Hath wash'd since winter. -- Come, 'tis bravely done--
	You should have been a hunter. -- Follow me.
			[As they descend the rocks with difficulty, the scene closes]
END OF ACT THE FIRST

SCENE I. A Cottage amongst the Bernese Alps.
			MANFRED and the CHAMOIS HUNTER.

CHAMOIS HUNTER
	No, no -- yet pause -- thou must not yet go forth:
	Thy mind and body are alike unfit
	To trust each other, for some hours, at least;
	When thou art better, I will be thy guide--
	But whither?

MANFRED 
			It imports not: I do know
	My route full well, and need no further guidance.

CHAMOIS HUNTER
	Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage--
	One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags
	Look o'er the lower valleys -- which of these
	May call thee Lord? I only know their portals;
	My way of life leads me but rarely down
	To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,
	Carousing with the vassals; but the paths,
	Which step from out our mountains to their doors,
	I know from childhood -- which of these is thine?

MANFRED
	 No matter.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	Well, sir, pardon me the question,
	And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;
	'Tis of an ancient vintage; many a day
	'T has thawed my veins among our glaciers, now
	Let it do thus for thine -- Come, pledge me fairly.

MANFRED
	Away, away! there's blood upon the brim!
	Will it then never -- never sink in the earth?

CHAMOIS HUNTER
	What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.

MANFRED 
	I say 'tis blood -- my blood! the pure warm stream
	Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours
	When we were in our youth, and had one heart,
	And loved each other as we should not love,
	And this was shed: but still it rises up,
	Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from heaven,
	Where thou art not -- and I shall never be.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	Man of strange words, and some half-maddening sin,
	Which makes thee people vacancy, whate'er
	Thy dread and sufferance be, there's comfort yet--
	The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience--

MANFRED 
	Patience and patience! Hence -- that word was made
	For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey;
	Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,--
	I am not of thine order.

CHAMOIS HUNTER			 Thanks to heaven!
	I would not be of thine for the free fame
	Of William Tell; but whatsoe'er thine ill,
	It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless.

MANFRED 
	Do I not bear it? -- Look on me -- I live.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	This is convulsion, and no healthful life.

MANFRED 
	I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,
	Many long years, but they are nothing now
	To those which I must number: ages -- ages --
	Space and eternity -- and consciousness,
	With the fierce thirst of death -- and still unslaked!

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	Why, on thy brow the seal of middle age
	Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.

MANFRED 
	Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?
	It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine
	Have made my days and nights imperishable,
	Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,
	Innumerable atoms, and one desart,
	Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,
	But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
	Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.
	
CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	Alas! he's mad -- but yet I must not leave him.

MANFRED 
	I would I were -- for then the things I see
	Would be but a distempered dream.

CHAMOIS HUNTER
					What is it
	That thou dost see, or think thou look'st upon?
MANFRED
	Myself, and thee -- a peasant of the Alps--
	Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,
	And spirit patient, pious, proud and free;
	Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;
	Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,
	By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes
	Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,
	With cross and garland over its green turf,
	And thy grandchildren's love for epitaph;
	This do I see -- and then I look within --
	It matters not -- my soul was scorch'd already!

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	And wouldst thou then exchange thy lot for mine?

MANFRED 
	No, friend! I would not wrong thee, nor exchange
	My lot with living being: I can bear--
	However wretchedly, 'tis still to bear--
	In life what others could not brook to dream,
	But perish in their slumber.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
					And with this--
	This cautious feeling for another's pain,
	Canst thou be black with evil? -- say not so.
	Can one of gentle thoughts have wreak'd revenge
	Upon his enemies?

MANFRED 
				Oh! no, no, no!
	My injuries came down on those who loved me--
	On those whom I best loved: I never quell'd
	An enemy, save in my just defence--
	My wrongs were all on those I should have cherished--
	But my embrace was fatal.

CHAMOIS HUNTER 
	Heaven give thee rest!
	And penitence restore thee to thyself;
	My prayers shall be for thee.

MANFRED
					I need them not,
	But can endure thy pity. I depart--
	'Tis time -- farewell! -- Here's gold, and thanks for thee--
	No words -- it is thy due. -- Follow me not --
	I know my path -- the mountain's peril's past:--
	And once again, I charge thee, follow not!
							[Exit MANFRED
SCENE II. A lower Valley in the Alps. -- A Cataract.
				Enter MANFRED

MANFRED 
	It is not noon -- the sunbow's rays still arch
	The torrent with the many hues of heaven,
	And roll the sheeted silver's waving column
	O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,
	And fling its lines of foaming light along,
	And to and fro, like the pale courser's tail,
	The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death,
	As told in the Apocalypse. No eyes
	But mine now drink this sight of loveliness;
	I should be sole in this sweet solitude,
	And with the Spirit of the place divide
	The homage of these waters. -- I will call her.

[MANFRED takes some of the water into the palm of his hand, and flings it in the air, muttering 
	the adjuration. After a pause, the WITCH OF THE ALPS rises beneath the arch of the sunbow 
	of the torrent]

MANFRED 
	Beautiful Spirit! with thy hair of light,
	And dazzling eyes of glory, in whose form
	The charms of Earth's least-mortal daughters grow
	To an unearthly stature, in an essence
	Of purer elements; while the hues of youth,--
	Carnation'd like a sleeping infant's cheek,
	Rock'd by the beating of her mother's heart,
	Or the rose tints, which summer's twilight leaves
	Upon the lofty glacier's virgin snow,
	The blush of earth embracing with her heaven,--
	Tinge thy celestial aspect, and make tame
	The beauties of the sunbow which bends o'er thee.
	Beautiful Spirit! in thy calm clear brow,
	Wherein is glass'd serenity of soul,
	Which of itself shows immortality,
	I read that thou wilt pardon to a Son
	Of Earth, whom the abstruser powers permit
	At times to commune with them -- if that he
	Avail him of his spells -- to call thee thus,
	And gaze on thee a moment.

WITCH 
				Son of Earth!
	I know thee, and the powers which give thee power;
	I know thee for a man of many thoughts,
	And deeds of good and ill, extreme in both,
	Fatal and fated in thy sufferings.
	I have expected this -- what wouldst thou with me?

MANFRED 
	To look upon thy beauty -- nothing further.
	The face of the Earth hath madden'd me, and I
	Take refuge in her mysteries, and pierce

	To the abodes of those who govern her--
	But they can nothing aid me. I have sought
	From them what they could not bestow, and now
	I search no further.

WITCH 
			What could be the quest
	Which is not in the power of the most powerful,
	The rulers of the invisible?

MANFRED 
				A boon;
	But why should I repeat it? 'twere in vain.

WITCH 
	I know not that; let thy lips utter it.
MANFRED 
	Well, though it torture me, 'tis but the same;
	My pang shall find a voice. From my youth upwards
	My spirit walk'd not with the souls of men,
	Nor look'd upon the earth with human eyes;
	The thirst of their ambition was not mine,
	The aim of their existence was not mine;
	My joys, my griefs, my passions, and my powers,
	Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,
	I had no sympathy with breathing flesh,
	Nor midst the creatures of clay that girded me
	Was there but one who but of her anon.
	I said, with men, and with the thoughts of men,
	I held but slight communion; but instead,
	My joy was in the Wilderness, to breathe
	The difficult air of the iced mountain's top,
	Where the birds dare not build, nor insect's wing
	Flit o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge
	Into the torrent, and to roll along
	On the swift whirl of the new breaking wave
	Of river-stream, or ocean, in their flow.
	In these my early strength exulted; or
	To follow through the night the moving moon,
	The stars and their developement; or catch
	The dazzling lightnings till my eyes grew dim;
	Or to look, list'ning, on the scattered leaves,
	While Autumn winds were at their evening song.
	These were my pastimes, and to be alone;
	For if the beings, of whom I was one, --
	Hating to be so, -- cross'd me in my path,
	I felt myself degraded back to them,
	And was all clay again. And then I dived,
	In my lone wanderings, to the caves of death,
	Searching its cause in its effect; and drew
	From wither'd bones, and skulls, and heap'd up dust,
	Conclusions most forbidden. Then I pass'd
	The nights of years in sciences untaught,
	Save in the old-time; and with time and toil,
	And terrible ordeal, and such penance
	As in itself hath power upon the air,
	And spirits that do compass air and earth,
	Space, and the peopled infinite, I made
	Mine eyes familiar with Eternity,
	Such as, before me, did the Magi, and
	He who from out their fountain dwellings raised
	Eros and Anteros, at Gadara,
	As I do thee; -- and with my knowledge grew
	The thirst of knowledge, and the power and joy
	Of this most bright intelligence, until --

WITCH 
	Proceed.

MANFRED 
		Oh! I but thus prolonged my words,
	Boasting these idle attributes, because
	As I approach the core of my heart's grief--
	But to my task. I have not named to thee
	Father or mother, mistress, friend, or being,
	With whom I wore the chain of human ties;
	If I had such, they seem'd not such to me--
	Yet there was one

WITCH 
	Spare not thyself -- proceed.

MANFRED 
	She was like me in lineaments -- her eyes,
	Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone
	Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;
	But soften'd all, and temper'd into beauty;
	She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,
	The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind
	To comprehend the universe: nor these
	Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,
	Pity, and smiles, and tears -- which I had not;
	And tenderness -- but that I had for her;
	Humility -- and that I never had.
	Her faults were mine -- her virtues were her own--
	I loved her, and destroy'd her!

WITCH 
	With thy hand?

MANFRED 
	Not with my hand, but heart -- which broke her heart --
	It gazed on mine, and withered. I have shed
	Blood, but not hers -- and yet her blood was shed --
	I saw -- and could not staunch it.

WITCH
					And for this--
	A being of the race thou dost despise,
	The order which thine own would rise above,
	Mingling with us and ours, thou dost forgo
	The gifts of our great knowledge, and shrink'st back
	To recreant mortality -- Away!

MANFRED 
	Daughter of Air! I tell thee, since that hour --
	But words are breath -- look on me in my sleep,
	Or watch my watchings -- Come and sit by me!
	My solitude is solitude no more,
	But peopled with the Furies; -- I have gnash'd
	My teeth in darkness till returning morn,
	Then cursed myself till sunset; -- I have pray'd
	For madness as a blessing -- 'tis denied me.
	I have affronted death -- but in the war
	Of elements the waters shrunk from me,
	And fatal things pass'd harmless -- the cold hand
	Of an all-pitiless demon held me back,
	Back by a single hair, which would not break.
	In phantasy, imagination, all
	The affluence of my soul -- which one day was
	A Croesus in creation -- I plunged deep,
	But, like an ebbing wave, it dash'd me back
	Into the gulf of my unfathom'd thought.
	I plunged amidst mankind -- Forgetfulness
	I sought in all, save where 'tis to be found,
	And that I have to learn -- my sciences,
	My long pursued and super-human art,
	Is mortal here -- I dwell in my despair --
	And live -- and live for ever.

WITCH 
					It may be
	That I can aid thee.

MANFRED 
				To do this thy power
	Must wake the dead, or lay me low with them.
	Do so -- in any shape -- in any hour --
	With any torture -- so it be the last.

WITCH 
	That is not in my province; but if thou
	Wilt swear obedience to my will, and do
	My bidding, it may help thee to thy wishes.

MANFRED 
	I will not swear -- Obey! and whom? the spirits
	Whose presence I command, and be the slave
	Of those who served me -- Never!

WITCH 					Is this all?
	Hast thou no gentler answer --Yet bethink thee,
	And pause ere thou rejectest.
MANFRED 
					I have said it.

WITCH 
	Enough! -- I may retire then -- say!

MANFRED
						Retire!

MAN. [alone] 
	We are the fools of time and terror. Days
	Steal on us and steal from us; yet we live
	Loathing our life, and dreading still to die.
	In all the days of this detested yoke --
	This heaving burthen, this accursed breath --
	This vital weight upon the struggling heart,
	Which sinks with sorrow, or beats quick with pain
	Or joy that ends in agony or faintness --
	In all the days of past and future, for
	In life there is no present, we can number
	How few -- how less than few -- wherein the soul
	Forbears to pant for death, and yet draws back
	As from a stream in winter, though the chill
	Be but a moment's. I have one resource
	Still in my science -- I can call the dead
	And ask them what it is we dread to be.
	The sternest answer can but be the Grave,
	And that is nothing -- if they answer not --
	The buried Prophet answered to the Hag
	Of Endor; and the Spartan Monarch drew
	From the Byzantine maid's unsleeping spirit
	An answer and his destiny -- he slew
	That which he loved, unknowing what he slew,
	And died unpardon'd -- though he call'd in aid
	The Phyxian Jove, and in Phigalia roused
	The Arcadian Evocators to compel
	The indignant shadow to depose her wrath,
	Or fix her term of vengeance -- she replied
	In words of dubious import, but fulfilled.

	If I had never lived, that which I love
	Had still been living; had I never loved,
	That which I love would still be beautiful --
	Happy and giving happiness. What is she?
	What is she now? -- a sufferer for my sins --
	A thing I dare not think upon -- or nothing.
	Within few hours I shall not call in vain --
	Yet in this hour I dread the thing I dare:
	Until this hour I never shrunk to gaze
	On spirit, good or evil -- now I tremble,
	And feel a strange cold thaw upon my heart,
	But I can act even what I most abhor,
	And champion human fears. -- The night approaches.		[Exit

	The moon is rising broad, and round, and bright;
	And here on snows, where never human foot
	Of common mortal trod, we nightly tread,
	And leave no traces; o'er the savage sea,
	The glassy ocean of the mountain ice,
	We skim its rugged breakers, which put on
	The aspect of a tumbling tempest's foam,
	Frozen in a moment -- a dead whirlpool's image;
	And this most steep fantastic pinnacle,
	The fretwork of some earthquake -- where the clouds
	Pause to repose themselves in passing by --
	Is sacred to our revels, or our vigils;
	Here do I wait my sisters, on our way
	To the Hall of Arimanes, for to-night
	Is our great festival -- 'tis strange they come not.

		  I shivered his chain,

	With a nation's destruction -- his flight and despair.

	Save one, whom I held, as he swam, by the hair,
	And he was a subject well worthy my care;
	A traitor on land, and a pirate at sea --
	But I saved him to wreak further havoc for me!

	    Hail to our Master! -- Prince of Earth and Air! --
		Who walks the clouds and waters -- in his hand
	    The sceptre of the elements, which tear
		Themselves to chaos at his high command!
	    He breatheth -- and a tempest shakes the sea;
		He speaketh -- and the clouds reply in thunder;
	    He gazeth -- from his glance the sunbeams flee;
		He moveth -- earthquakes rend the world asunder.
	    Beneath his footsteps the volcanos rise;
		His shadow is the Pestilence; his path
	    The comets herald through the crackling skies;
		And planets turn to ashes at his wrath.
	    To him War offers daily sacrifice;
		To him Death pays his tribute, Life is his,
	    With all its infinite of agonies --

ALL THE SPIRITS 
	Prostrate thyself, and thy condemned clay

MANFRED 
					I know it;
	And yet ye see I kneel not.

FOURTH SPIRIT 
				'Twill be taught thee.

MANFRED 
	'Tis taught already; -- many a night on the earth,
	On the bare ground, have I bow'd down my face,
	And strew'd my head with ashes; I have known
	The fulness of humiliation, for
	I sunk before my vain despair, and knelt
	To my own desolation.

FIFTH SPIRIT 				Dost thou dare
	Refuse to Arimanes on his throne
	What the whole earth accords, beholding not
	The terror of his Glory -- Crouch! I say.

					Crush the worm!
	Tear him in pieces!--

FIRST DESTINY 
				Hence! Avaunt! -- he's mine.
	Prince of the Powers invisible! This man
	Is of no common order, as his port
	And presence here denote; his sufferings
	Have been of an immortal nature, like
	Our own; his knowledge and his powers and will,
	As far as is compatible with clay,
	Which clogs the etherial essence, have been such
	As clay hath seldom borne; his aspirations
	Have been beyond the dwellers of the earth,
	And they have only taught him what we know --
	That knowledge is not happiness, and science
	But an exchange of ignorance for that
	Which is another kind of ignorance.
	This is not all -- the passions, attributes
	Of earth and heaven, from which no power, nor being,
	Nor breath from the worm upwards is exempt,
	Have pierced his heart; and in their consequence
	Made him a thing, which I, who pity not,
	Yet pardon those who pity. He is mine,
	And thine, it may be -- be it so, or not,
	No other Spirit in this region hath
	A soul like his -- or power upon his soul.

NEMESIS 
	What doth he here then?

FIRST DESTINY
				Let him answer that.

MANFRED 
	Ye know what I have known, and without power
	I could not be amongst ye: but there are
	Powers deeper still beyond -- I come in quest
	Of such, to answer unto what I seek.

NEMESIS 
	What wouldst thou?

MANFRED 
				Thou canst not reply to me.
	Call up the dead-my question is for them.
		
NEMESIS 
	Great Arimanes, doth thy will avouch
	The wishes of this mortal?

ARIMANES
				Yea.

NEM
					Whom wouldst thou
	Uncharnel?

MANFRED
		One without a tomb -- call up
	Astarte.

		Shadow! or Spirit!
		  Whatever thou art,
		Which still doth inherit
		  The whole or a part
		Of the form of thy birth,
		  Of the mould of thy clay,
		Which returned to the earth,
		  Re-appear to the day!
		Bear what thou borest,
		  The heart and the form,
		And the aspect thou worest
		  Redeem from the worm.
		Appear! -- Appear! -- Appear!
		Who sent thee there requires thee here!

	[The Phantom of ASTARTE rises and stands in the midst]

MANFRED 
	Can this be death? there's bloom upon her cheek;
	But now I see it is no living hue,
	But a strange hectic -- like the unnatural red
	Which Autumn plants upon the perish'd leaf.
	It is the same! Oh, God! that I should dread
	To look upon the same -- Astarte! -- No,
	I cannot speak to her -- but bid her speak --
	Forgive me or condemn me.

				NEMESIS

		By the power which hath broken
		  The grave which enthrall'd thee,
		Speak to him who hath spoken,
		  Or those who have call'd thee!

MANFRED
					She is silent.
	And in that silence I am more than answered.

NEMESIS 
	My power extends no further. Prince of air!
	It rests with thee alone -- command her voice,

ARIMANES 
	Spirit -- obey this sceptre!

NEMESIS 
					Silent still!
	She is not of our order, but belongs
	To the other powers. Mortal! thy quest is vain,
	And we are baffled also.

MANFRED 
				Hear me, hear me --
	Astarte! my beloved! speak to me:
	I have so much endured -- so much endure --
	Look on me! the grave hath not changed thee more
	Than I am changed for thee. Thou lovedst me
	Too much, as I loved thee: we were not made
	To torture thus each other, though it were
	The deadliest sin to love as we have loved.
	Say that thou loath'st me not -- that I do bear
	This punishment for both -- that thou wilt be
	One of the blessed -- and that I shall die,
	For hitherto all hateful things conspire
	To bind me in existence -- in a life
	Which makes me shrink from immortality --
	A future like the past. I cannot rest.
	I know not what I ask, nor what I seek:
	I feel but what thou art -- and what I am;
	And I would hear yet once before I perish
	The voice which was my music -- Speak to me!
	For I have call'd on thee in the still night,
	Startled the slumbering birds from the hush'd boughs,
	And woke the mountain wolves, and made the caves
	Acquainted with thy vainly echoed name,
	Which answered me -- many things answered me --
	Spirits and men -- but thou wert silent all.
	Yet speak to me! I have outwatch'd the stars,
	And gazed o'er heaven in vain in search of thee.
	Speak to me! I have wandered o'er the earth
	And never found thy likeness -- Speak to me!
	Look on the fiends around -- they feel for me:
	I fear them not, and feel for thee alone --
	Speak to me! though it be in wrath, -- but say --
	I reck not what -- but let me hear thee once --
	This once -- once more!

PHANTOM OF ASTARTE 
				Manfred!

MANFRED 
					Say on, say on --
	I live but in the sound -- it is thy voice!

PHANTOM 
	Manfred! To-morrow ends thine earthly ills.
	Farewell!

MANFRED
	Yet one word more -- am I forgiven?
		
PHANTOM
	Farewell!

MANFRED
		Say, shall we meet again?

PHANTOM
	 				Farewell!

MANFRED

SCENE I. A Hall in the Castle of Manfred

			MANFRED and HERMAN

MANFRED 
	What is the hour?

HERMAN 
			It wants but one till sunset,
	And promises a lovely twilight.

MANFRED
					Say,
	Are all things so disposed of in the tower
	As I directed?

HERMAN
			All, my lord, are ready;
	Here is the key and casket.

MANFRED	
					It is well:
	Thou mayst retire.				[Exit HERMAN
	[alone]       There is a calm upon me --
	Inexplicable stillness! which till now
	Did not belong to what I knew of life.
	If that I did not know philosophy
	To be of all our vanities the motliest,
	The merest word that ever fool'd the ear
	From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem
	The golden secret, the sought 'Kalon', found,
	And seated in my soul. It will not last,
	But it is well to have known it, though but once:
	It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,
	And I within my tablets would note down
	That there is such a feeling. Who is there?

			Re-enter HERMAN

HERMAN
	My lord, the abbot of St Maurice craves
	To greet your presence.

		Enter the ABBOT OF ST MAURICE

ABBOT 
				Peace be with Count Manfred!

MANFRED 
	Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;
	Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those
	Who dwell within them.

ABBOT 
				Would it were so, Count! -- 
	But I would fain confer with thee alone.

MANFRED 
	Herman, retire. What would my reverend guest?
							[Exit HERMAN

ABBOT 
	Thus, without prelude: -- Age and zeal, my office,
	And good intent, must plead my privilege;
	Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,
	May also be my herald. Rumours strange
	And of unholy nature, are abroad,
	And busy with thy name; a noble name
	For centuries; may he who bears it now
	Transmit it unimpair'd!
MANFRED
				Proceed, -- I listen.
ABBOT 
	'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things
	Which are forbidden to the search of man;
	That with the dwellers of the dark abodes
	The many evil and unheavenly spirits
	Which walk the valley of the shade of death,
	Thou communest. I know that with mankind,
	Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely
	Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude
	Is as an anchorite's, were it but holy.

MANFRED 
	And what are they who do avouch these things?

ABBOT 
	My pious brethren -- the scared peasantry --
	Even thy own vassals -- who do look on thee
	With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril.

MANFRED 
	Take it.

ABBOT 
		I come to save, and not destroy --
	I would not pry into thy secret soul;
	But if these things be sooth, there still is time
	For penitence and pity: reconcile thee
	With the true church, and through the church to heaven.

MANFRED 
	I hear thee. This is my reply; whate'er
	I may have been, or am, doth rest between
	Heaven and myself. -- I shall not choose a mortal
	To be my mediator. Have I sinn'd
	Against your ordinances? prove and punish!

ABBOT 
	My son! I did not speak of punishment,
	But penitence and pardon; -- with thyself
	The choice of such remains -- and for the last,
	Our institutions and our strong belief
	Have given me power to smooth the path from sin
	To higher hope and better thoughts; the first
	I leave to heaven -- 'Vengeance is mine alone!'
	So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness
	His servant echoes back the awful word.

MANFRED
	Old man! there is no power in holy men,
	Nor charm in prayer -- nor purifying form
	Of penitence -- nor outward look -- nor fast --
	Nor agony -- nor, greater than all these,
	The innate tortures of that deep despair,
	Which is remorse without the fear of hell,
	But all in all sufficient to itself
	Would make a hell of heaven -- can exorcise
	From out the unbounded spirit, the quick sense
	Of its own sins, wrongs, sufferance, and revenge
	Upon itself; there is no future pang
	Can deal that justice on the self-condemn'd
	He deals on his own soul.

ABBOT 
				All this is well;
	For this will pass away, and be succeeded
	By an auspicious hope, which shall look up
	With calm assurance to that blessed place,
	Which all who seek may win, whatever be
	Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:
	And the commencement of atonement is
	The sense of its necessity. -- Say on --
	And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;
	And all we can absolve thee, shall be pardon'd.

MANFRED 
	When Rome's sixth Emperor was near his last,
	The victim of a self-inflicted wound,
	To shun the torments of a public death
	From senates once his slaves, a certain soldier,
	With show of loyal pity, would have staunch'd
	The gushing throat with his officious robe,
	The dying Roman thrust him back and said--
	Some empire still in his expiring glance,
	'It is too late -- is this fidelity?'

ABBOT 
	And what of this?

MANFRED 
			I answer with the Roman--
	'It is too late!'

ABBOT
			It never can be so,
	To reconcile thyself with thy own soul,
	And thy own soul with heaven. Hast thou no hope?
	'Tis strange-even those who do despair above,
	Yet shape themselves some phantasy on earth,
	To which frail twig they cling, like drowning men.

MANFRED 
	Ay -- father! I have had those earthly visions
	And noble aspirations in my youth,
	To make my own the mind of other men,
	The enlightener of nations; and to rise
	I knew not whither -- it might be to fall;
	But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,
	Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,
	Even in the foaming strength of its abyss,
	(Which casts up misty columns that become
	Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies)
	Lies low but mighty still. -- But this is past,
	My thoughts mistook themselves.

ABBOT 
					And wherefore so?

MANFRED 
	I could not tame my nature down; for he
	Must serve who fain would sway -- and soothe -- and sue --
	And watch all time -- and pry into all place --
	And be a living lie -- who would become
	A mighty thing amongst the mean, and such
	The mass are; I disdained to mingle with
	A herd, though to be leader -- and of wolves.
	The lion is alone, and so am 1.

ABBOT 
	And why not live and act with other men?

MANFRED 
	Because my nature was averse from life;
	And yet not cruel; for I would not make,
	But find a desolation: --Like the wind,
	The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,
	Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er
	The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,
	And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,
	And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,
	But being met is deadly; such hath been
	The course of my existence; but there came
	Things in my path which are no more.

ABBOT
					Alas!
	I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid
	From me and from my calling, yet so young,
	I still would --

MANFRED	
			Look on me! there is an order
	Of mortals on the earth, who do become
	Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,
	Without the violence of warlike death;
	Some perishing of pleasure -- some of study --
	Some worn with toil -- some of mere weariness --
	Some of disease -- and some insanity --
	And some of withered, or of broken hearts;
	For this last is a malady which slays
	More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,
	Taking all shapes, and bearing many names.
	Look upon me! for even of all these things			
	Have I partaken; and of all these things,
	One were enough; then wonder not that I
	Am what I am, but that I ever was,
	Or, having been, that I am still on earth.

ABBOT 
	Yet, hear me still --

MANFRED
			Old man! I do respect
	Thine order, and revere thine years; I deem
	Thy purpose pious, but it is in vain:
	Think me not churlish; I would spare thyself,
	Far more than me, in shunning at this time
	All further colloquy -- and so -- farewell.		[Exit MANFRED

ABBOT 
	This should have been a noble creature: he
	Hath all the energy which would have made
	A goodly frame of glorious elements,
	Had they been wisely mingled; as it is,
	It is an awful chaos -- light and darkness --
	And mind and dust -- and passions and pure thoughts,
	Mix'd, and contending without end or order,
	All dormant or destructive: he will perish,
	And yet he must not; I will try once more,
	For such are worth redemption; and my duty
	Is to dare all things for a righteous end.
	I'll follow him -- but cautiously, though surely.	[Exit ABBOT

SCENE II. Another Chamber

			MANFRED and HERMAN.

HERMAN 
	My Lord, you bade me wait on you at sunset:
	He sinks behind the mountain.

MANFRED	
					Doth he so?
	I will look on him.
						[MANFRED advances to the Windom of the Hall
			Glorious Orb! the idol
	Of early nature, and the vigorous race
	Of undiseased mankind, the giant sons
	Of the embrace of angels, with a sex
	More beautiful than they, which did draw down
	The erring spirits who can ne'er return. --
	Most glorious orb! that wert a worship, ere
	The mystery of thy making was reveal'd!
	Thou earliest minister of the Almighty,
	Which gladden'd, on their mountain tops, the hearts
	Of the Chaldean shepherds, till they pour'd
	Themselves in orisons! Thou material God!
	And representative of the Unknown --
	Who chose thee for his shadow! Thou chief star!
	Centre of many stars! which mak'st our earth
	Endurable, and temperest the hues
	And hearts of all who walk within thy rays!
	Sire of the seasons! Monarch of the climes,
	And those who dwell in them! for near or far,
	Our inborn spirits have a tint of thee,
	Even as our outward aspects; -- thou dost rise,
	And shine, and set in glory. Fare thee well!
	I ne'er shall see thee more. As my first glance
	Of love and wonder was for thee, then take
	My latest look: thou wilt not beam on one
	To whom the gifts of life and warmth have been
	Of a more fatal nature. He is gone:
	I follow.						[Exit MANFRED

SCENE III. The Mountains. -- The Castle of Manfred at some distance. -- A Terrace before a Tower. -- Time, Twilight.

	HERMAN, MANUEL, and other Dependents of MANFRED,

HERMAN 
	'Tis strange enough; night after night, for years,
	He hath pursued long vigils in this tower,
	Without a witness. I have been within it, --
	So have we all been oft-times; but from it,
	Or its contents, it were impossible
	To draw conclusions absolute, of aught
	His studies tend to. To be sure, there is
	One chamber where none enter; I would give
	The fee of what I have to come these three years,
	To pore upon its mysteries.

MANUEL
					'Twere dangerous;
	Content thyself with what thou knowest already.

HERMAN 
	Ah! Manuel! thou art elderly and wise,
	And couldst say much; thou hast dwelt within the castle -- 
	How many years is't?

MANUEL 
			Ere Count Manfred's birth,
	I served his father, whom he nought resembles.

HERMAN 
	There be more sons in like predicament.
	But wherein do they differ?

MANUEL 
				I speak not
	Of features or of form, but mind and habits:
	Count Sigismund was proud, -- but gay and free, --
	A warrior and a reveller; he dwelt not
	With books and solitude, nor made the night
	A gloomy vigil, but a festal time,
	Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks
	And forests like a wolf, nor turn aside
	From men and their delights.

HERMAN 
					Beshrew the hour,
	But those were jocund times! I would that such
	Would visit the old walls again; they look
	As if they had forgotten them.

MANUEL 
					These walls
	Must change their chieftain first. Oh! I have seen
	Some strange things in them, Herman.


HERMAN 
					Come, be friendly;

HERMAN
	Relate me some to while away our watch:
	I've heard thee darkly speak of an event
	Which happened hereabouts, by this same tower.

MANUEL 
	That was a night indeed; I do remember
	'Twas twilight, as it may be now, and such
	Another evening; -- yon red cloud, which rests
	On Eigher's pinnacle, so rested then,
	So like that it might be the same; the wind
	Was faint and gusty, and the mountain snows
	Began to glitter with the climbing moon;
	Count Manfred was, as now, within his tower, -- 
	How occupied, we knew not, but with him
	The sole companion of his wanderings
	And watchings her, whom of all earthly things
	That lived, the only thing he seem'd to love,
	As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,
	The lady Astarte, his --
				Hush! who comes here?

			Enter the ABBOT

ABBOT 
	Where is your master?

HERMAN
				Yonder, in the tower.

ABBOT 
	I must speak with him.

MANUEL 
				'Tis impossible;
	He is most private, and must not be thus
	Intruded on.

ABBOT 
			Upon myself I take
	The forfeit of my fault, if fault there be --
	But I must see him.

HERMAN 
			Thou hast seen him once
	This eve already.

ABBOT 
				Sirrah! I command thee,
	Knock, and apprize the Count of my approach.

HERMAN 
	We dare not.

ABBOT 
			Then it seems I must be herald
	Of my own purpose.

MANUEL 
			Reverend father, stop --
	I pray you pause.

ABBOT 
				Why so?

MANUEL	
					But step this way,
	And I will tell you further.				Exeunt

SCENE IV. Interior of the Tower.

			MANFRED alone.

MANFRED 
	The stars are forth, the moon above the tops
	Of the snow-shining mountains. -- Beautiful!
	I linger yet with Nature, for the night
	Hath been to me a more familiar face
	Than that of man; and in her starry shade
	Of dim and solitary loveliness,
	I learn'd the language of another world.
	I do remember me, that in my youth,
	When I was wandering, -- upon such a night
	I stood within the Colosseum's wall,
	'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;
	The trees which grew along the broken arches
	Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars
	Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar
	The watchdog bayed beyond the Tiber; and
	More near from out the Caesars' palace came
	The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,
	Of distant sentinels the fitful song
	Begun and died upon the gentle wind.
	Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach
	Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood
	Within a bowshot -- where the Caesars dwelt,
	And dwell the tuneless birds of night; amidst
	A grove which springs through levell'd battlements,
	And twines its roots with the imperial hearths,
	Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth; --
	But the gladiators' bloody Circus stands,
	A noble wreck in ruinous perfection!
	While Caesar's chambers, and the Augustan halls,
	Grovel on earth in indistinct decay. --
	And thou didst shine, thou rolling moon, upon
	All this, and cast a wide and tender light,
	Which soften'd down the hoar austerity
	Of rugged desolation, and fill'd up,
	As 'twere, anew, the gaps of centuries;
	Leaving that beautiful which still was so,
	And making that which was not, till the place
	Became religion, and the heart ran o'er
	With silent worship of the great of old! --
	The dead, but sceptred sovereigns, who still rule
	Our spirits from their urns. --
					'Twas such a night!
	'Tis strange that I recall it at this time;
	Rut I have found our thoughts take wildest flight
	Even at the moment when they should array
	Themselves in pensive order.

			Enter the ABBOT

ABBOT 
					My good Lord!
	I crave a second grace for this approach;
	But yet let not my humble zeal offend
	By its abruptness -- all it hath of ill
	Recoils on me; its good in the effect
	May light upon your head -- could I say heart --
	Could I touch that, with words or prayers, I should
	Recall a noble spirit which hath wandered,
	But is not yet all lost.

MANFRED 
				Thou know'st me not;
	My days are numbered, and my deeds recorded:
	Retire, or 'twill be dangerous -- Away!

ABBOT 
	Thou dost not mean to menace me?

MANFRED
					Not I;
	I simply tell thee peril is at hand,
	And would preserve thee.

ABBOT
				What dost mean?

MANFRED
						Look there!

	What dost thou see?

ABBOT 
				Nothing.

MANFRED	
					Look there, I say,
	And steadfastly; -- now tell me what thou seest?

ABBOT 
	That which should shake me, -- but I fear it not --
	I see a dusk and awful figure rise
	Like an infernal god from out the earth;
	His face wrapt in a mantle, and his form
	Robed as with angry clouds; he stands between
	Thyself and me -- but I do fear him not.

MANFRED 
	Thou hast no cause -- he shall not harm thee -- but
	His sight may shock thine old limbs into palsy.
	I say to thee -- Retire!

ABBOT 
				And, I reply --
	Never -- till I have battled with this fiend --
	What doth he here?

MANFRED 
	Why -- ay -- what doth he here?
	I did not send for him, -- he is unbidden.

ABBOT 
	Alas! lost mortal! what with guests like these
	Hast thou to do? I tremble for thy sake;
	Why doth he gaze on thee, and thou on him?
	Ah! he unveils his aspect; on his brow
	The thunder-sears are graven; from his eye
	Glares forth the immortality of hell -- 
	Avaunt! --

MANFRED 
	Pronounce -- what is thy mission?

SPIRIT	
					Come!

ABBOT 
	What art thou, unknown being? answer! -- speak!

SPIRIT
	The genius of this mortal. -- Come! 'tis time.

MANFRED 
	I am prepared for all things, but deny
	The power which summons me. Who sent thee here?

SPIRIT  
	Thou'lt know anon -- Come! come!

MANFRED
					I have commanded
	Things of an essence greater far than thine,
	And striven with thy masters. Get thee hence!

SPIRIT 
	Mortal! thine hour is come -- Away! I say.

MANFRED 
	I knew, and know my hour is come, but not
	To render up my soul to such as thee:
	Away! I'll die as I have lived -- alone.

SPIRIT 
	Then I must summon up my brethren. -- Rise!
							[Other Spirits rise up

ABBOT 
	Avaunt! ye evil ones! -- Avaunt! I say,
	Ye have no power where piety hath power,
	And I do charge ye in the name --

SPIRIT 
					Old man!
	We know ourselves, our mission, and thine order;
	Waste not thy holy words on idle uses,
	It were in vain; this man is forfeited.
	Once more I summon him -- Away! away!

MANFRED 
	I do defy ye, -- though I feel my soul
	Is ebbing from me, yet I do defy ye;
	Nor will I hence, while I have earthly breath
	I o breathe my scorn upon ye -- earthly strength
	To wrestle, though with spirits; what ye take
	Shall be ta'en limb by limb.

SPIRIT
				Reluctant mortal!
	Is this the Magian who would so pervade
	The world invisible, and make himself
	Almost our equal? -- Can it be that thou
	Art thus in love with life? the very life
	Which made thee wretched!

MANFRED
	Thou false fiend, thou liest!
	My life is in its last hour, -- that I know,
	Nor would redeem a moment of that hour;
	I do not combat against death, but thee
	And thy surrounding angels; my past power
	Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,
	But by superior science -- penance -- daring --
	And length of watching -- strength of mind -- and skill
	In knowledge of our fathers -- when the earth
	Saw men and spirits walking side by side
	And gave ye no supremacy: I stand
	Upon my strength -- I do defy -- deny --
	Spurn back, and scorn ye! --

SPIRIT
				But thy many crimes
	Have made thee --

MANFRED 
			What are they to such as thee?
	Must crimes be punish'd but by other crimes,
	And greater criminals? -- Back to thy hell!
	Thou hast no power upon me, that I feel;
	Thou never shalt possess me, that I know:
	What I have done is done; I bear within
	A torture which could nothing gain from thine:
	The mind which is immortal makes itself
	Requital for its good or evil thoughts --
	Is its own origin of ill and end --
	And its own place and time -- its innate sense,
	When stripp'd of this mortality, derives
	No colour from the fleeting things without,
	But is absorb'd in sufferance or in joy,
	Born from the knowledge of its own desert.
	Thou didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me;
	I have not been thy dupe, nor am thy prey --
	But was my own destroyer, and will be
	My own hereafter. -- Back, ye baffled fiends!
	The hand of death is on me -- but not yours!
							[The Demons disappear

ABBOT 
	Alas! how pale thou art -- thy lips are white --
	And thy breast heaves -- and in thy gasping throat
	The accents rattle -- Give thy prayers to heaven --
	Pray -- albeit but in thought, -- but die not thus.

MANFRED 
	'Tis over -- my dull eyes can fix thee not;
	But all things swim around m, and the earth
	Heaves as it were beneath me. Fare thee well --
	Give me thy hand.

ABBOT
			Cold -- cold -- even to the heart --
	But yet one prayer -- alas! how fares it with thee? --

MANFRED 
	Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.
							[MANFRED expires

ABBOT
	He's gone -- his soul hath ta'en its earthless flight --
	Whither? I dread to think -- but he is gone.
